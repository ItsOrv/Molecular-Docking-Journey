# Step 1: Introduction to Molecular Docking

Hey, welcome to the first step of my molecular docking journey!

## What is Molecular Docking?
Molecular docking is a cool computational method that predicts how two molecules, like a protein and a small drug, interact with each other. It’s a key part of drug design because it shows how a drug might bind to its target protein.

## Why I’m Diving In
I’m studying Biotechnology, and my genetics professor suggested I give molecular docking a try during the mid-term break. After checking it out, I got hooked because it perfectly mixes biology, chemistry, and computer science.

## What to Expect in This Repo
- **Basics:** I’ll explain all the fundamental concepts behind molecular docking.
- **Setup:** I’ll show you how I got my Linux Mint system ready with AutoDock Tools and Vina.
- **Experiments:** A step-by-step guide to running my first docking experiments.
- **Analysis:** Tips and tricks on how to analyze the results using data from PDB and PubChem.

Let’s jump in and explore this fascinating field together!
