Step 2: Installation & Setup on Linux Mint

In this step, I'm walking you through setting up my Linux Mint environment for molecular docking. Linux Mint is awesome—lightweight, user-friendly, and perfect for running the tools we need.

What You'll Need

Linux Mint (or any Linux distro): Make sure your system is updated.

Essential Applications:

Chimera

AutoDock Tools & AutoDock Vina

PRAS

Yasara

PyMOL


Python & Bash: For automation and scripting.

Internet Connection: To download all the necessary packages.


Step-by-Step Setup

1. Update Your System

Before you do anything, open your terminal and run:

sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade

This ensures your system is up-to-date with the latest software.

2. Download and Install the Applications

Instead of getting into all the nitty-gritty of terminal commands for each app, just head over to their official websites and download the latest versions.

3. Verify Python Installation

Make sure you have Python installed by checking the version:

python3 --version

If you need to install Python 3, run:

sudo apt install python3

4. Set Up Your Workspace

Create a clean directory structure to keep your project organized:

mkdir -p ~/docking_project/{docs,notebooks,scripts,data}

Staying organized makes life easier!

Wrapping Up

That’s it for the installation part! By updating your system and downloading the necessary apps from their official websites, you’re all set up for some molecular docking fun. If you run into any issues, just drop a note in the repo’s issues section. Next up, we’ll run our first docking experiment!
