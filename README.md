# Molecular Docking Journey

Hey there! Welcome to my repository where I document my journey into the awesome world of molecular docking. I'm a second-semester Biotechnology student in Iran, and I'm super excited about bioinformatics, genetics, and all that cool science and tech stuff.

In this repo, you'll find everything from the basics of molecular docking to running my very first docking experiments. 
and i'm working on Linux Mint.

## What's Inside
- **[Step 1: Introduction](docs/intro.md):**
- **[Step 2: Installation & Setup on Linux](docs/installation.md):**
- **[Step 3: My First Docking Experiment](docs/first-docking.md):** A step-by-step guide on running my very first docking experiment.
- **[Step 4: Analysis & Results](docs/analysis.md):** How I analyze the results, including tips on using data from PDB and PubChem.

Feel free to browse around, learn with me, and maybe even try it yourself. Iâ€™ll keep updating this repo as I learn more. Happy docking!
